    "description": "I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with a keen interest in User Experience. âš¡ I like to work on software products that people want and deep tech innovations. I give my 100% on products that resonate with me. Apart from building software, I like to do research & build communities with a purpose. I built @fnplus and organised workshops, hackathons and virtual events to get students build their technical skills by building projects. \n I like to connect with people and hearing their perspectives. Talk to me about tech, startups, entrepreneurship, space, games, video games, food, travel and conspiracy theories."
