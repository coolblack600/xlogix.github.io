    "bio": "I'm an entrepreneur at heart with engineering skills to execute. I love to work on big ideas which change the world for the better. Let's build something people want.",
    "description": "I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with a keen interest in User Experience. âš¡ I like to work on software products that people want and deep tech innovations. I give my 100% on products that resonate with me. Apart from building software, I like to do research, share my learnings & build communities with a purpose. I built @fnplus and organised workshops, hackathons and virtual events to get students build their technical skills by building projects. \n I like to connect with people and hearing their perspectives. Connect with me to talk about tech, open-source, entrepreneurship, products, space, games, video games, food, travel and conspiracy theories. We'll have fun :)"
