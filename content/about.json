    "description": "Hello World! I'm Abhishek, a learner with a zeal to stay curious and passionate about the things I make and do. The core values that push me every day are integrity, commitment, and smart work. Some of the things that excite me are emerging technologies & products, which I like to play with daily. \n Being a founder before and an early employee, I have worn many hats & still do! Apart from full-stack software engineering, I've answered customer support calls, usability tests, evangelised, recruited employees, designed marketing assets, and closed partnership deals. \n I believe in building for everyone, which involves being aware of different perspectives, so I like to bounce ideas with people and get their opinion. Reach out if you want to talk about tech, startups, entrepreneurship, space, games, video games, food, travel, and conspiracy theories."
