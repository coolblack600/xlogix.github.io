    "description": "Instify was initially developed to prevent the spread of fake news in my college, which was affected by a natural disaster (flood) by crawling the offical website and sending real-time updates to everyone. Later, it became a companion app for students to check their attendance, test scores, chat with each other and share study notes. It was built using the MVC Design Pattern.",
