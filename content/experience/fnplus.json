    "description": "Fnplus AKA FunctionPlus began with the need for practical, applied-learning projects to supplement the college's engineering curriculum. During my college days, I felt the need to help students with applied technical skills to get equal opportunities regardless of the college they come from. The problem we found was measuring skills objectively around technical & non-technical skills for which we created a framework to work with. \n We created a gamified platform for college students to sign up and solve business problem statements with a technology solution which we could track. Data & Insights gathered in form of journeys was used to put together a 'Devfolio' which could be used to identify the core competencies of students and help identify quality talent. They started looking at their applied learning journeys instead of resumes.",
