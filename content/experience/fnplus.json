    "description": "Fnplus AKA FunctionPlus, born in my dorm room, is solving the skills gap in software engineering among engineering students. During my stint as a part-time freelancer, I noticed the lack of applied skills among my peers, which eventually made me look at the bigger picture of a real problem affecting students worldwide. Moreover, instead of taking a traditional \"Join Bootcamp and get skilled\" approach to solving the problem, I thought about solving it via a customized learning platform that could facilitate self-learning with gamification. As a result, each individual's learning journey composed of peer-learning, projects, community contributions were put together objectively in a \"Geekfolio\", giving access to work opportunities at partner companies.",
    "tasks": [
        "We researched and prototyped gamified learning platform which ensured maximum retention and fun while learning with community members.",
        "We Developed programs, curriculum, and philosophy. I built the customer experience & community of self-learning geeks in multiple cities of India.",
        "Launched the platform & established a community base of 1K+ students.",
        "Interviewed, appointed, trained, and assigned responsibility to cross-functional teams.",
        "I managed an agile team of 5 across product engineering & social media marketing.",
        "I coordinated with marketing and engineering teams to unify product vision & strategy."
